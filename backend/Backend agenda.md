 - [x] List all required algorithms (not all but most of what i could see for the moment)
 - [x] Create basic template from which i could start development
 - [x] Start implement basic things
I assume we going to be able to load data with price for multiple coins 

Algorithms:
- [ ] Generation of Eadge: Not only implement but also find out which algorithm could be the best for this application => Basically i think that most of my frustration is coming from the fact that i can not see 100% clear in which complex should we use  
- [ ] Bar generation : should be straight forward as soon as we figure out  step 1
- [ ] Computation of the attractive forces 
- [ ] Computation of the repulsive forces
- [ ] Spring forces
- [ ] Data processing (all mechanisms how we should feed data inside algorithm)
- [ ] Data storage  (inside graph structure)
- [ ] Data visualization (how and in which format we should send data to the front)
