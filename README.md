## Overview

ADA-Kosmos (also known as ADA Kosmos) is a data visualization platform for the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. It uses graph visualization and market data to create interactive visuals that show relationships between tokens, wallets, and market trends that aren't visible in standard data formats.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization:** Interactive 3D graphs powered by [`TokensGraphClient`](frontend/app/(app)/dashboard/components/TokensGraphClient.tsx).
- **Market Analytics:** Displays token liquidity, price, and market capitalization using services like [`MarketTokensApiService`](frontend/services/MarketTokensApiService.ts).
- **Wallet Explorer:** Explore on-chain wallet data with dynamic UI components (e.g. [`WalletExplorer`](frontend/components/sidebar/walletExplorer/walletExplorer.tsx)).
- **Robust API Integration:** Implements a consistent API contract using TypeScript interfaces and generics.

## Project Structure
### Backend

- **Language:** C++ with CMake for build management.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Fetching and processing token data (see [`topLiquidityTokens.cpp`](backend/src/requests/topLiquidityTokens.cpp) and [`tokenPriceOHLCV.cpp`](backend/src/requests/tokenPriceOHLCV.cpp)).
  - Generating graph datasets (see [`computatuions.cpp`](backend/src/data/computations.cpp))
- **Dependencies:** libcurl, nlohmann-json.
- **Configuration:** API keys should be placed in the `.key` file located inside the backend directory.
- **Documentation:** See [Backend README](backend/README.md) for detailed setup and development instructions.

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js & React.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Providing an interactive dashboard.
  - Managing API calls and state using services like [`MarketTokensApiService`](frontend/services/MarketTokensApiService.ts) and context providers (see [`SelectedTokenContext`](frontend/contexts/SelectedTokenContext.tsx)).
- **Visualization:** Utilizes 3D force-directed graphs for token visualization ([`FocusGraph`](frontend/app/(app)/dashboard/components/FocusGraph.tsx)).
- **Documentation:** See [Frontend README](frontend/README.MD) for detailed setup and development instructions.

## Problem Statement

The Cardano ecosystem generates large amounts of complex data that's hard to understand through traditional means:

- **Data Overload:** The volume of token data, transactions, and market movements creates information overload that standard dashboards can't present clearly.
- **Hidden Relationships:** Important relationships between tokens, such as price correlations, liquidity pools, and shared holder bases, aren't visible in typical market data.
- **Fragmented Information:** Relevant data is spread across multiple platforms, forcing users to switch between different services.
- **Accessibility Barriers:** Technical expertise is often needed to access and interpret on-chain data, creating obstacles for casual users.
- **Structural Insights Gap:** There's a lack of tools that show the underlying structural relationships in the Cardano ecosystem.
